I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, working with Prof. [Kristin Persson](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/kristin-persson). 
I received my M.S. in Chemical Engineering at Rutger University in 2014, where I worked with Prof. [Alexander Neimark](http://coewww.rutgers.edu/~aneimark/) to simulate the chromatographic separation of polymers and nanoparticles using Monte Carlo and dissipative particle dynamics simulations. 
I then completed my Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering with Prof. [Kesong Yang](http://materials.ucsd.edu/) from the University of California, San Diego in 2018. My Ph.D. research mainly focused on designing two-dimensional electron gas in perovskite oxides heterointerfaces that have the potential for all-oxide field-effect transistors application using the high-throughput computational screening and first-principles calculations. 
In addition, I developed a novel and efficient algorithm to generate periodic grain boundary structures. I implemented this algorithm in an open-source Python library, [aimsgb](https://github.com/ksyang2013/aimsgb), and a [web GUI](http://aimsgb.org/) for an easy access.

My current research focuses on a variety of thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanic phenomena generally observed in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and searching for new functional materials and design principles using atomistic simulations, data science and machine learning. Specifically, I have been investigating the degradation mechanisms of high energy- density cathode materials and developing theory-guided mitigation strategies, such as targeted doping and surface coating, to improve the performance and lifetime of LIBs.
