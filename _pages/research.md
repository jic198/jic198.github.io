My current research leverages a suite of multi-scale computational tools, ranging from electronic structure calculations
to molecular dynamics, from high-throughput materials informatics to machine learning interatomic potentials, to study a
variety of thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanic phenomena generally observed in lithium-ion batteries and searching
for new functional materials and design principles.


## Data-driven interfacial engineering to design high-energy Li-ion batteries

Future improvements in LIBs envision the use of lithium metal as the anode paired with high energy density cathode materials, 
such as high nickel layered oxides. However, these electrodes frequently experience surface instability with associated 
performance degradation under extended cycling. Therefore, it is critical to engineer the electrode surface to achieve 
high-energy LIBs with a safe and long-term cycling performance.

I use materials informatics, high-throughput simulations and machine learning to develop an interfacial engineering
approach to stabilize the electrode surface. The screening criteria of selecting protective coatings include thermodynamic, 
electrochemical, chemical and mechanical stability, electronic conductivity and ionic diffusion of the electrode coatings.
I have, for the first time, developed materials design principles governing amorphous cathode coating selections. Current,
I am developing machine-learning interatomic potentials to study ionic diffusion and mechanical properties of electrode
coatings.
