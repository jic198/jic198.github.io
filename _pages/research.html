My current research leverages a suite of multi-scale computational tools, ranging from electronic structure calculations
to molecular dynamics, from high-throughput materials informatics to machine learning interatomic potentials, to study a
variety of thermodynamic, kinetic, and mechanic phenomena generally observed in lithium-ion batteries and searching
for new functional materials and design principles.
